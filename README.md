# Tamarind - A WebGL shader editor

Tamarind is named after the [tamarind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarind) fruit, which is not connected in any meaningful way with WebGL, but is delicious in aromatic currys and cocktails. I suggest that you use lowercase tamarind as a component in a whisky sour cocktail to add flavour complexity, and uppercase Tamarind as a component in web applications to remove shader development complexity.

# Running

You can run demos and tests from the HTML files in the dist folder. For development, including live reloading of code changes, use:

```
npm install gulp-cli
npm install
gulp live
```
