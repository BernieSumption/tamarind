# tamarind - A WebGL shader editor

Tamarind is named after the [tamarind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarind) fruit, which is not connected in any meaningful way with WebGL, but is delicious in aromatic currys and cocktails. I suggest that you use lowercase tamarind as component in a whisky sour cocktail to add flavour complexity, and uppercase Tamarind as a component in web applications to remove shader rendering complexity.
